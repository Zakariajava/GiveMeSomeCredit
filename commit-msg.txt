feat(preprocessing): add robust preprocessing pipeline with imputation, clipping, log1p, scaling and missing flags

- Added custom transformers:
  - QuantileClipper(low=1%, high=99%): clips each column using quantiles learned from the training set (handles heavy tails/outliers).
  - ValueClipper(min/max): fixed hard clipping for logical ranges (e.g. age 18–100).
  - RoundInt: rounds imputed numeric values to the nearest integer (used for dependents).

- Defined column groups:
  - POS_SKEW: RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines, DebtRatio, MonthlyIncome (impute → clip → log1p → RobustScaler)
  - COUNT_COLS: NumberOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans, NumberOfTimes90DaysLate, NumberOfTime30-59DaysPastDueNotWorse, NumberOfTime60-89DaysPastDueNotWorse, NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines (clip → RobustScaler)
  - AGE_COL: age (ValueClipper[18,100] → RobustScaler)
  - DEPENDENTS_COL: NumberOfDependents (impute median → RoundInt → clip → RobustScaler)

- Robust imputation:
  - MonthlyIncome and NumberOfDependents imputed with column median (less sensitive to skew/outliers).
  - Added binary missing flags (MissingIndicator) for both columns to preserve missingness information.

- Skew correction:
  - Applied FunctionTransformer(np.log1p) to POS_SKEW columns to reduce right-skew and stabilize distributions.

- Scaling:
  - Used RobustScaler (median/IQR) instead of StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler to minimize outlier influence.

- ColumnTransformer orchestration:
  - Applies each pipeline block in parallel and concatenates results.
  - Includes missing indicators as separate branches (seeing original NaNs).
  - remainder="drop" keeps only defined FEATURES.

- No data leakage:
  - preprocess.fit_transform(X_train) learns medians, quantiles, and scales only from the training data.
  - preprocess.transform(X_val/test) reuses those parameters without refitting.

- Outputs:
  - Transformed X_train_t, X_val_t, X_test_t with printed shapes for verification.

Motivation:
Dataset contains heavy tails (RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines, DebtRatio, MonthlyIncome),
missing values (~20% in MonthlyIncome, ~3.6% in NumberOfDependents),
and extreme sentinel values (e.g. 98 in delinquency counts).
The pipeline robustly handles outliers, preserves missingness signal, and normalizes skew before modeling.
